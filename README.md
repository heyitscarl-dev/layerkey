# layerkey
A compiler for the layerkey markup language.

## introduction

I recently started experimenting with creating custom keyboard layouts.
In doing this, I noticed that there really isn't a good tool for creating
and visualizing these custom layouts.

So, I set out to create a tool that let's you declaratively define keyboard 
layouts, including multiple layers, tap-hold functionality, etc.

## functionality

Since there are already great pre-existing tools for processing and remapping keys,
I decided to use the [kanata](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata) tool instead of writing
my own.

## visualisation

To keep it simple, I just use HTML, CSS and vanilla JS to visualize keyboard layouts.
